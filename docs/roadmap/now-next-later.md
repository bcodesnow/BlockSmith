# Roadmap

This roadmap is organized into Now, Next, and Later tracks.

## Now

- Multi-tab behavior hardening
  - close-flow consistency for dirty tabs
  - safer app-close behavior for unsaved edits
  - clearer active-context handling between tabs and JSONL viewer
- Documentation and information architecture cleanup
- Ongoing UI polish and reliability fixes

## Next

- Markdown table editing workflow
  - cell navigation
  - row/column operations
  - alignment helpers
- Spell checking integration
- Minimap-style document navigation

## Later

- Git-aware project tree and status indicators
- In-app diff views
- Basic git actions (stage/unstage/commit)
- Block system depth features (versioning/templates/cross-project sync)
- Extensibility and plugin-style workflows

See [backlog.md](backlog.md) for the broader candidate list.
